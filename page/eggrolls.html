                    Chinese egg rolls are closely related to spring rolls 
                    however, egg rolls are completely different from the spring 
                    roll. Its origin remains unclear and mysterious, people only 
                    know that egg rolls are from GuanDong, China. It is a sort
                    of deep-fried food, with the crispy flour skin that’s fried in 
                    boiling oil. Inside the fragrant skin wraps a mix of chopped 
                    pork, pieces of cabbage and other ingredients. After the hot
                    bath it had within the pot, the roll was served onto the table 
                    and later drowned by the sauces. Egg rolls are a standard
                    holiday desert of the Han nationality, popular in all parts of 
                    China. The rolls not only served their homes but also used 
                    for hospitality. It has a long history and evolved from 
                    ancient spring cakes. According to the ancient book "Sui 
                    Shi Guang Ji" by Chen Yuanliang: “"In the spring day, we 
                    eat spring cakes, lettuce, and the spring plate." The Qing 
                    Dynasty "Yen Jing Sui Shi Ji" also stated: "In spring, rich 
                    people eat spring cakes. "”</p>

                    ( BaiDuBaiKe N.D.). It are often seen that the folks custom 
                    of creating spring cakes in spring and eating spring cakes 
                    features a long history. There are many proverbs about 
                    spring rolls, such as "A roll does not make spring", 
                    "Longshengtang's spring rolls-inside and outside are not 
                    people" and so on. Spring means the season spring, and 
                    there is an honest sign of welcoming the spring in china.</p>

        <h2>Difference between Chinese egg roll and spring roll:</h2>
        <p>The egg roll is made using flour and eggs, 
            which provides it a harder and sturdier 
            texture and there will be bubbles appearing 
            on the skin when it’s fried. It’s crispy on 
            the surface and thick and doughy on the 
            within. on the other hand, the Spring rolls 
            have a skinny flour wrapper with no eggs 
            used in the making. It is very light and 
            flaky, when fried it becomes delicately 
            crispy and crunchy all the way through.
            Spring rolls have a more extended history 
            compared to egg rolls in china and are 
            more popular than the egg rolls. However 
            egg rolls and spring rolls both are 
            significant to Chinese culture and will
            never be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Approximate time taken: 40min- 110min.
            Nowadays, egg rolls spread to other parts 
            of the globe. “There are numerous other 
            versions of egg rolls in other countries like 
            vietnam, india, USA , UK and even 
            australia.” (TasteAtlas 2016). However, 
            the egg rolls are always native to china and 
            are a apart of chinese culture。</p>
