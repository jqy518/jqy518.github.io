                    Chinese egg rolls are closely related to spring rolls 
                    however, egg rolls are completely different from the spring 
                    roll. Its origin remains unclear and mysterious, people only 
                    know that egg rolls are from GuanDong, China. It is a sort
                    of deep-fried food, with the crispy flour skin that’s fried in 
                    boiling oil. Inside the fragrant skin wraps a mix of chopped 
                    pork, pieces of cabbage and other ingredients. After the hot
                    bath it had within the pot, the roll was served onto the table 
                    and later drowned by the sauces. Egg rolls are a standard
                    holiday desert of the Han nationality, popular in all parts of 
                    China. The rolls not only served their homes but also used 
                    for hospitality. It has a long history and evolved from 
                    ancient spring cakes. According to the ancient book "Sui 
                    Shi Guang Ji" by Chen Yuanliang: “"In the spring day, we 
                    eat spring cakes, lettuce, and the spring plate." The Qing 
                    Dynasty "Yen Jing Sui Shi Ji" also stated: "In spring, rich 
                    people eat spring cakes. "”</p>
                <p> <img src="images/7.jpg" align="left" width="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" />
                    ( BaiDuBaiKe N.D.). It are often seen that the folks custom 
                    of creating spring cakes in spring and eating spring cakes 
                    features a long history. There are many proverbs about 
                    spring rolls, such as "A roll does not make spring", 
                    "Longshengtang's spring rolls-inside and outside are not 
                    people" and so on. Spring means the season spring, and 
                    there is an honest sign of welcoming the spring in china.</p>

        <h2>Difference between Chinese egg roll and spring roll:</h2>
        <p>The egg roll is made using flour and eggs, 
            which provides it a harder and sturdier 
            texture and there will be bubbles appearing 
            on the skin when it’s fried. It’s crispy on 
            the surface and thick and doughy on the 
            within. on the other hand, the Spring rolls 
            have a skinny flour wrapper with no eggs 
            used in the making. It is very light and 
            flaky, when fried it becomes delicately 
            crispy and crunchy all the way through.
            Spring rolls have a more extended history 
            compared to egg rolls in china and are 
            more popular than the egg rolls. However 
            egg rolls and spring rolls both are 
            significant to Chinese culture and will
            never be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Approximate time taken: 40min- 110min.
            Nowadays, egg rolls spread to other parts 
            of the globe. “There are numerous other 
            versions of egg rolls in other countries like 
            vietnam, india, USA , UK and even 
            australia.” (TasteAtlas 2016). However, 
            the egg rolls are always native to china and 
            are a apart of chinese culture。</p>

                    The delicious food of Guangdong do not only consist of Zongzi and reagular wine but also consist of Claypot rice (Bao Zai Fan) that people can see on the daily life on Guangdong people. The Claypot rice appears in the life of Guangdong people for already 2000 years which is during the prosperous Han dynasty, and it had been first practiced around area such as Guangzhou, Hefei, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Shandong (baidu baike). It have slowly spread to different parts of China and being adapted by part of the world as time pass. Bao Zai Fan have its special magic which makes it hard for people to forget its appearance and taste. The origin of the Bao Zai Fan and the steps of making the special type of Bao Zai Fan are the interesting topics we will be talking about through out the essay.</p>
                <p>The history of Claypot rice have started in a book of Han dynasty named “Li Ji Zhu Shu” which people have first make Claypot rice using a type of rice name Panicum miliaceum that is considered a very expansive food around that time period. It have turned into a food that is only for the empress and the emperor in the Tang Dynasty . After the Tang Dynasty, it follow the same recipe until the modern day that the world is more peaceful so people have time to improve the recipe.</p>
                <p>Even though the Claypot rice have a long history, the dish used to hold the Claypot rice in place had never change which is always a clay. This is also one of the reason that China is keep making clay because it is always needed for the food and it could also help the increase of economic by providing more jobs and give more way to poor people to survive and make money (baidu baike). The Claypot rice have also developed a social hierarchy which is determine by the quality of the clay. A way to identify a good clay is to check if there is a golden crusty and crispy layer of rice at the bottom once the food is cooked. A good clay will also make a smoky, slightly burnt flavor of the dish that brings out the smell of rice and different type of food such as chicken and sausage (Leng 2018). Another important factor that determine the social class of claypot rice is the rice it is using. The rice with high social status will be long and easy to break with a shiny appearance. The peasants in the hierarchy of claypot rice will be having a exactly opposite properties as the elites, but you don’t need to worry that much even if you have unfortunately pick the peasants because it will get into a higher classes after you give it a bath (baidu baike).</p>

                <h2>Introduction: </h2>
                <p>
                    Guangdong has a lot of delicious food such as seafood, slice cold chicken, and steamed
rice in clay pot, these food attracts a lot of foodies coming to Guangdong. This article is base on one of the most classic food in Guangdong called Wonton noodle, which is a Chinese form of pasta. Compared to pasta in western countries which has a heavy taste with cream and milk, Wonton noodle has a light-taste soup using meat broth as the main ingredient. Moreover, it does not include big chunks of meat in it with only few shrimps in the wonton; the egg noodle is the main character of the dish. It doesn’t include preservative as well, which matches with the basic discipline for the dish: freshness.</p>
                <p>The wonton was originated in Guangzhou, Guangdong in the Qin Dynasty, Wonton noodles were not given their name until Tang Dynasty. In the 20th century, people started to add noodles into Wonton soup and created Wonton noodles.</p>
                <p><img src="images/3.png" style="float: right;" height="200" />Although Guangdong has the most authentic Wonton noodle, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam has their versions of Wonton noodles too. Malaysians serve Wonton noodles relatively dry, and the noodle is dressed with oyster sauce and garnished with chopped spring onions. Some stalls include deep-fried wontons in the dry versions as well. In Philippines, there are three distinct types of wonton noodle dishes found. First, people there uses mami, which is a noodle soup that has egg noodles, wontons, and various vegetables in a hot broth. Secondly, pancit molo, which is similar to mami, however, the noodles that are use for this type is the wonton wrappers themselves. Lastly, a third type of wonton noodles are stir-fry egg noodles sold by hawkers and in small "stand-up" type stalls.(wikipedia N.D)

                        There are many interesting legends of wonton noodle. The most famous one is about the Xiongnu in Chinese history. During the Han Dynasty, the Huns from northern place often harasses the border areas, they are causing lots of trouble there. The citizens there are distracted and cant have a normal life. There are two military counselor that helps the Xiongnu’s army. They were named "Hun" and "Tun". They are very ferocious and the citizens hate them deeply. Therefore, people invented wonton, they use flour wrapper to wrap meat and name it as wonton(Hun and Tun). They eat them to express the hate and wishes for peace(Baidu). Furthermore, there is another legend for wonton noodle. In the warring state period, king Fu Chai of the state of Wu defeated the state of Yue and captured king Gou Bian. In the same time, they captured a peerless beautiful girl name Xi Shi. After the victory of Wu, king Fu Chai is hedonistic and plays, dance, drinking and sex everyday. During a winter, king of Wu is still accepting tributes. All kind of delicious things are given to king Fu Chai, but he does not want to eat it. Xi Shi sees this in the eye and wanted do something. She went to the kitchen, she mixed the dough and rolled out the dough, making a new kind of food to cater Fu Chai. The leather turns to few patterns in Xi Shi's hand. Finally, she finish wrapping and put them into boiled water and add them into fresh soup. At last, she added some garlic, pepper, and a drop of sesame oil. She give it to king of Wu and he think it is extremely delicious. He ate a big bowl of it. Fu Chai asked repeatedly “what is this dessert?” Xi Shi laughed in secret. She said to herself that this fatuous ruler is dum and only know how to play and is muddle everyday. She replies to the king and told him this is called "Wonton"(In here, the Wonton symbolizes the hedonistic of King Fu Chai)(Baidu).</p>

                <h2>Introduction: </h2>
                <p>Steamed vermicelli roll is a kind of traditional food in guangdong, it is
                    famous in most of China as breakfast. It is made of rice paste and special salty sauce. Different city in guangdong adds different ingredients according to their preference. The most common ones are eggs, lettuce, pork, and shrimp. (China daily)</p>
                <p>The creation of steamed vermicelli roll is actually a accident. In the early Tang Dynasty, two buddhist monk called huineng and huiji made a kind of Ci, but Ci that’s created were too thin to be divided into pieces , so huineng and huiji shoveled them back into a pile and then divided into sections, they founded that this new Ci tasted very unique and was different from the previous one, and they start making it and spread it. That is how steamed vermicelli roll is made.(Guangzhou travel guide)</p>
                <p><img src="images/7.png" style="float: right;" height="200" />Vermicelli has a long history. It is said that it originated from Longzhou (now Luoding, Guangdong) in the Tang Dynasty. The local people call it "longkan Ci". The name of vermicelli has a bright history. During the reign Emperor Qianlong, he traveled to the south of the Yangtze River. After listening to the advice of Ji Xiaolan about how delicious steamed vermicelli roll is, he went to Luoding to try it. When he ate this kind of smooth food, Qianlong was full surprised and said: this does not really taste like Ci, it's a bit like pig intestines. It's better to call it vermicelli. Hence this kind of food is named vermicelli. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the selling of vermicelli were already very famous in Guangdong.(Baidu baike)
                    Steamed vermicelli roll is not only famous in guangdong, many people in different province of China likes to eat it. The Honglicun steamed vermicelli roll restaurant had 108 branchs in China. During the spread of Steamed vermicelli roll, it also evolved into lots of different kind and became the traditional food of lots of different provinces.(honglicun official website)
                    There were two types of steamed vermicelli roll that were most known by people, the Drawer type vermicelli and the Boulard vermicelli. The drawer type is the original type that made by the Buddhist monk huineng and huiji made, it’s the most original steamed vermicelli roll and it’s the type most people eats. The boulard vermicelli is most famous around guangxi province, it’s thinner compared to the original drawer type vermicelli roll. The most important difference between the two type is that they focus on different part of the steamed vermicelli roll. The boulard is mainly focusing on the taste of ingredients (most of the sausage paste is made of glutinous rice flour and corn starch), the ingredients were chosen carefully and collocation reasonable, but the drawer type is mainly focusing on the sauce for the vermicelli roll, they made special salty sauce by adding some Oyster sauce and sugar. Also, there were many other kinds of steamed vermicelli roll, for example Juan vermicelli roll( Juan means circle in Chinese), this kind of steamed vermicelli roll is also famous in Guangong, they do not add any ingredients, it’s only vermicelli roll made of rice paste, and because of that people can make the kind of sauce they like, they can even make them sweet.(Baidu baike N.D)</p>
