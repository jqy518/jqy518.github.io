                    (BaiDu N.D.). the other two Species are consistent with local customs and habits In some places, fish and meat are used instead, fish means "surplus every year", eating meat means "great wealth", and even some places use fruits and vegetables instead. Experienced elderly people also will put these seven dishes together and fry them together-they will have everything after frying them! The local custom are different, the fruits and vegetable used are different, and therefore the intentions are also different. Hakka people use celery, garlic, green onions, coriander, leeks and fish, meat, etc.; Taiwan and Fujian use spinach, celery, green onions and garlic, leeks, mustard greens, shepherd's purse, cabbage, and more. Chinese also practice the tradition climbing mountains or hiking and composing poems on this day, which is formed in Ancient China. Most Chinese believe that if Renri lands on a sunny day, it will bring the fortune of a flouring population, good luck and peace in the new year. For a lady to give birth on today was considered a excellent and blessed event. Nowadays, some Chinese people still celebrate the festival as a part of Chinese New Year, mainly by making a “soup of seven treasures” with seven fresh seasonal vegetables like leek, leaf mustard, and celery. Some people also climb mountains during the festival to enhance their health.
